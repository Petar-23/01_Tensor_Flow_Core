Fundamentals of TensorFlow
So guys, this is the TensorFlow tutorial I talked about in class.

For the best experience pls download the python distribution called anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
Notice: if you open it you will see different python development applications. One will be called jupyter Notebook -> This is our tool!

Next: Pls download the the whole git_folder (respository) to your machine.
Notice: This repo contains two .ipynb files -> these are the two jupyter notebooks I've created.

Next: Start jupyter notebook on your machine, the browser will open.
      Select open and navigate to the folder you downloaded and saved to your machine
      Open the TensorFlow tutorial.ipynb file and work through it (have fun!)
      Notice: If everything works properly you can execute the written code by yourself and play around with it.

Next: The second notebook (MNIST with TensorFlow) contains your lab example in which we decided to code an artificial intelligence
      which is able to recognize handwritten digits.
      Please, follow along if you are curious.
      My reco: Read some stuff about the way how ANN are working to get a better understanding while working lone-wulf.
      But dont worry, I am going to explain everything in the lab.
      
Guys, most importantly: thank you for your time and patience I really hope you get some valuable insights by working with me
Looking forward to seeing you in the lab.

kind regards, 
Petar
